# E-COMMERCE-DATA-PIPELINES
E-COMMERCE DATA PIPELINES
Project Overview
The E-COMMERCE DATA PIPELINES project is a data engineering project that aims to collect, pre-process, and store data from various e-commerce platforms. The project was developed using Python, and it uses various libraries and tools such as Pandas, SQLAlchemy, and Docker.

Project Responsibilities
The project is responsible for the following tasks:

Collecting data from various e-commerce platforms using APIs and web scraping techniques
Pre-processing the collected data to ensure its consistency and quality
Creating a database to store the pre-processed data
Designing and implementing a data pipeline that efficiently and reliably stores the data in the database
Developing a RESTful API to retrieve data from the database
Dockerizing the project for easy deployment and scaling
Technical Details
The project uses the following tools and technologies:

Python 3
Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning
SQLAlchemy for database management
Flask for developing the RESTful API
Docker for containerization and deployment
GitHub Actions for continuous integration and testing
GitHub Packages for storing and sharing Docker images
GitHub Pages for hosting the project documentation and portfolio website
Project Architecture
The project architecture consists of the following components:

Data Collection Layer: This layer is responsible for collecting data from various e-commerce platforms using APIs and web scraping techniques.

Data Processing Layer: This layer is responsible for pre-processing the collected data to ensure its consistency and quality. This layer uses Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.

Data Storage Layer: This layer is responsible for creating and managing the database that stores the pre-processed data. This layer uses SQLAlchemy to interact with the database.

Data Pipeline Layer: This layer is responsible for designing and implementing a data pipeline that efficiently and reliably stores the data in the database. This layer uses Python scripts to automate the data processing and storage tasks.

RESTful API Layer: This layer is responsible for developing a RESTful API that allows users to retrieve data from the database. This layer uses Flask to develop the API.

Deployment Layer: This layer is responsible for containerizing the project using Docker for easy deployment and scaling. This layer uses GitHub Packages to store and share the Docker images.
